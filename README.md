# The Candela Engine

A realtime performance/graphics oriented 3D engine.

# Implemented 
- Model loading, abstracted program/application API
- Custom SAH BVH Constructor
- Support for Stack/Stackless traversal
- Cascaded Shadow Mapping
- Indirect Diffuse GI
- Infinite bounce GI using irradiance probes
- Hybrid Specular GI (SSR + World Space RT)
- SVGF + Specialized Specular Denoiser
- Temporal Anti Aliasing
- Volumetrics (Direct + Indirect light contribution)
- Upscaling (Temporal/Spatial)
- Culling (Frustum/Face Culling)
- Post Processing Pipeline (Bloom, DoF, Grain, Chromatic Aberration, Color Dithering, ACES Tonemapping etc.)
- Basic Editor Features + Debug Views
- Glass materials (OIT + Screenspace Refraction)

# Planned
- Transparent Shadows, Direct caustics, Screenspace Indirect glass caustics
- Debug Features (Lighting components, Material Properties, BVH, Wireframe)
- Sky rendering
- IES lights?
- LTC
